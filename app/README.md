# 🅿️ SmartPark - Android Design Patterns Demo

This project is a clean, modular Android application developed as a collaborative effort by a 3-member team to demonstrate key structural and behavioral design patterns in the context of a **Smart Parking Management System**.

## 👥 Team & Patterns

### 1. Developer 1: Alice (Global State Management)
**Implemented:** `Singleton Pattern`
- **File:** `patterns/singleton/ParkingManager.java`
- **Purpose:** Maintains a single, globally consistent control unit for the parking lot. Tracks total spots occupied, daily revenue, and the current attendant. Uses thread-safe double-checked locking to guarantee exactly one instance across the app lifecycle.

### 2. Developer 2: Bob (Object Creation)
**Implemented:** `Factory Pattern`
- **Files:** `patterns/factory/VehicleFactory.java`, `Vehicle.java`, `Sedan.java`, `TwoWheeler.java`, `HeavyTruck.java`
- **Purpose:** Centralizes the creation of vehicle objects (Sedan, Two-Wheeler, Heavy Truck) via a single `createVehicle(type, plate)` call. Decouples the UI from concrete vehicle classes, making it trivial to add new vehicle types.

### 3. Developer 3: Charlie (Event Broadcasting)
**Implemented:** `Observer Pattern`
- **File:** `patterns/observer/RevenueNotifier.java`
- **Purpose:** Keeps the revenue display and any registered UI listeners automatically synchronized with vehicle entry/exit events. Observers implement the `RevenueObserver` interface and are notified via `notifyVehicleEntry()` on each parking event.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Select **Import Project** and point to the `app/` directory.
3. Ensure you have the **Material Components** and **RecyclerView** libraries in your `build.gradle` (automatically handled by modern Studio builds).
4. Run on an Emulator or Physical Device.
